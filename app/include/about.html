				<h2>An Investment Team Founded On Core Principles</h2>
				<p>Think Huge Investments was founded with one goal in mind; to provide you with an alternative and
					highly profitable investment vehicle.</p>
				<p>Our vastly experienced traders capitalize on inefficiencies in the global currency market (Forex) to
					frequently capture profitable opportunities. Over time the accumulation of all this trades
					transacted results in our ability to outperform most other investment vehicles. We have the
					potential to aggressively grow your wealth rapidly.</p>
				<p>Most clients understand that in order to achieve higher than average returns, we must take on higher
					than average risk. Having said that, when you invest with Think Huge Investments you can be assured
					that the stability of your investment is one of our primary concerns. We operate under three key
					methodologies: Complete Transparency, Highly Experienced Institutional Quality Traders and the
					Financial Services Regulation (ASIC).</p>

				<h2>Your funds managed by experienced traders with their personal capital at stake</h2>
				<p>Every single trader on the team at Think Huge Investments has significant personal capital at stake
					in addition to the funds under management. All of the traders we approve of have been trading
					professionally for 5+ years and it’s our unique requirements that ensure our traders remain vigilant
					and committed to growing your funds over time.</p>
				<p>Our traders capitalise on currency movements within the world’s leading economies. Often
					opportunities last all but a few seconds and only the most skilled and talented individuals are able
					to identify, capture and convert the opportunities consistently over the long term.</p>
				<p>Every one of our traders has been through a rigorous vetting process (which can take up to 12 months
					to complete) to ensure that all client funds are managed with the utmost care and skill.</p>
				<p>This has been a key factor into why we’re able to achieve consistent and above market returns since
					our inception.</p>
