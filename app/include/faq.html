		<h2>How are you able to operate without charging management fees?</h2>
		<p>Our goal is transform the funds management arena by aligning our incentives with those of our clients. We do
			this a number of ways.</p>
		<p>1. We keep our recurring overheads low. We don’t rent expensive offices in the CBD or drive fancy company
			cars. Our support and administration staff are also located around the world to save on labour costs.</p>
		<p>2. We preserve company capital. During positive months we stockpile a portion of the fees collected to ensure
			we have working capital during poorer performing months.</p>
		<p>3. We believe performance is paramount. We only work with traders that have proven the ability to
			consistently make money through a careful, consistent approach to the market.</p>
		<h2>How are performance fees calculated?</h2>
		<p>Here at Think Huge Investments we only charge a performance fee on profits using the high-watermark method.
			The high-watermark is calculated from the highest Net Asset Value (NAV) after performance fees are
			calculated. </p>
		<p>The NAV is calculated on the value of the account at the end of each month.</p>

		<p>The above example assumes an initial investment of $100,00. If the strategy had achieved a return of 10% for
			the month, the clients investment would have grown to $110,000 during the month. The 30% performance fee for
			the first month is calculated on the $10,000 profit, therefore a $3,000 fee is automatically debited from
			the account. The now leaves the high-water mark at $107,000.</p>
		<p>If in the second month, the strategy generates a net loss of $2,000, no fee is payable and the the high-water
			mark remains at $107,000 as this is the highest previous level when the performance fee was last
			applied. </p>
		<p>In the third month, the strategy returns to profitability, generating $12,000 for the month and the balance
			of the account grows to $117,000. The previous high-water mark was $107,000, therefor the performance fee is
			only charged on the profit above this high water mark. i.e. 30% of $10,000 instead of 30% of $12,000.</p>
		<p>The important thing to remember is <em><strong>"If you.... make money, we .... make money"</strong></em></p>
		<h2>How can I monitor the progress of my investment?</h2>
		<p><strong>Daily Email</strong></p>
		<p>You receive a daily email on the balance of your investment as well as specifics on the trading activity that
			occurred on your account over the previous 24hrs. This email is sent each day when the New York market
			closes. </p>
		<p><strong>On your Phone (the most popular option)</strong></p>
		<p>Download the MT4 app on your smart phone and login using the credentials provided by AxiTrader. Once logged
			in you’ll be able to see your account trading live, 24hrs per day. A word of warning, checking this can be
			very addictive! </p>
		<p><strong>On your PC</strong></p>
		<p>Download the AxiTrader MT4 platform and login using the credentials provided. Here you’ll be watching the
			trading platform run live in a similar environment to that used by our trading team. Your credentials
			provide you with “read only” access, so you can’t trade the account directly, but you’ll be able to see your
			investment trading live in the market. </p>
		<p>The only condition when logging into MT4 through your PC is that you DO NOT stay logged in for longer than
			15mins at a time. This is very important, if you were to log in for an extended period of time you’ll
			receive a politely worded email requesting that you log out, if that request is ignored we may be forced to
			disconnect your account.</p>
		<p>At the end of the Australian financial year (June 30) the compliance team at HLK Group will also issue you an
			annual investor statement detailing the performance of your investment over the previous 12 months.</p>
		<h2>Can I withdraw my funds at any time?</h2>
		<p>You can withdraw up to $2,000 at any time through the brokers automated client control panel. Larger
			withdrawals are also requested through the same control panel, however we require approval from our risk
			assessment team to ensure your withdrawal won’t adversely affect the available margin on the account. This
			process can take up to 24hrs.</p>
		<h2>What happens if you go bankrupt, is my money safe?</h2>
		<p>Your funds are held in trust under your name with the executing broker AxiTrader. Think Huge Investments does
			not have access to your investment other than for the purpose of trading on your behalf. If the business is
			to becomes insolvent your investment is not effected and remains with the executing broker.</p>
		<p>AxiTrader have issued the following statement in relation to the security of funds held at their
			brokerage:</p>
		<p><em>All client funds are held in a segregated trust account with one of Australia’s largest banks, National
			Australia Bank, where client funds are separated from business funds at all times as per ASIC regulations.
			ASIC require regular reporting to ensure financial stability of the firm is maintained. If there is
			unforeseen situation where the firm was to become insolvent, ASIC would intervene during liquidation of a
			firm’s assets to assist in the returning of client funds. Furthermore as an additional buffer, brokers must
			maintain a $1 million AUD level of regulation capital to hold an Australian Financial Services License
			(AFSL) number.</em></p>
		<p><em>Moreover, “under the Australian Client Money Rules, we must hold your moneys on trust.”
			AxiTrader’s strength is evident as one of the largest Australian owned brokers with heavy investment into
			infrastructure for the benefit and protection of the client. A key example of this is while many global
			brokerage firms suffered significant losses after the Swiss National Bank (SNB) decision to remove the
			EURCHF floor early in 2015, with a several becoming insolvent, AxiTrader survived through strict controls,
			robust infrastructure and well calculated risk management strategies and polices. Even after such a
			significant event, we are still growing and expanding across the major financial hubs of Sydney, London and
			Dubai with additional presence in several emerging markets.</em></p>
		<p><em>"Over the past three to five years AxiTrader has reinvested a large percentage of its profits into
			infrastructure to better define and manage both customers’ and the firm’s risk, as well as working to excel
			in client execution with Axi’s counterparties." - AxiCorp CEO Goran Drapac</em></p>
