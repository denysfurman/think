											<p>The above example assumes that $100,000 was invested. If the Managed
												Account had achieved a return of 10% for the month, your account would
												now be at $110,000 for the month. The performance fee for the first
												month would be calculated on the profit. The performance fee is 30%,
												therefore $3,000 is charged to the account. The now leaves the
												high-water mark at $107,000.</p>
											<p>If in the second month of trading, the managed account made a net loss of
												$2,000, there would be no performance fee paid. However the high-water
												mark would remain at $107,000 as this remains the highest level after a
												performance fee has been taken.</p>
											<p>In the third month the Managed Account returned to profitability, and
												returned $12,000 for the quarter, the balance would now be at $117,000.
												However since the high-water mark is at $107,000, there performance fee
												is only charged on the profit above the high water mark. i.e. 30% of
												$10,000 instead of 30% of $12,000.</p>
