				<h2>When you invest with Think Huge you’re investing in an extremely rigorous and

				<p>Every Think Huge Investments trader has passed a highly-competitive and demanding battery of
					mathematical, statistical and personal analysis.</p>
				<p>Our process has six phases beginning with a preliminary screening that identifies and promotes the
					best risk adjusted and quantifiable performers. Only an extremely talented trader who has
					demonstrated a significant and lucrative statistical edge will be progressed to the next stage.</p>
				<p>A potential Think Huge trader is then required to fill out our custom due diligence questionnaire
					covering personal information, history, their past success-record and trading methodology. </p>
				<p>The final three phases progress to a more advanced analytical stage whereby we monitor in real-time
					any potential deviations from known historical metrics. We then allocate our own capital for
					"real-world" testing. Only after successful and prolonged trading with company funds is the trader
					then allocated investor capital.</p>
				<p>What's important is that we continue to monitor all traders and their performances to ensure your
					investment remains on track, all the time.</p>

						<h2>AxiTrader Statement</h2>
						<p>AxiTrader have issued the following statement in relation to the security of funds held at
							their brokerage:</p>
						<p>All client funds are held in a segregated trust account with one of Australia’s largest
							banks, National Australia Bank, where client funds are separated from business funds at all
							times as per ASIC regulations. ASIC require regular reporting to ensure financial stability
							of the firm is maintained. If there is unforeseen situation where the firm was to become
							insolvent, ASIC would intervene during liquidation of a firm’s assets to assist in the
							returning of client funds. Furthermore as an additional buffer, brokers must maintain a $1
							million AUD level of regulation capital to hold an Australian Financial Services License
							(AFSL) number.</p>
						<p>Moreover, “under the Australian Client Money Rules, we must hold your moneys on trust.”</p>
						<p>AxiTrader’s strength is evident as one of the largest Australian owned brokers with heavy
							investment into infrastructure for the benefit and protection of the client. A key example
							of this is while many global brokerage firms suffered significant losses after the Swiss
							National Bank (SNB) decision to remove the EURCHF floor early in 2015, with a several
							becoming insolvent, AxiTrader survived through strict controls, robust infrastructure and
							well calculated risk management strategies and polices. Even after such a significant event,
							we are still growing and expanding across the major financial hubs of Sydney, London and
							Dubai with additional presence in several emerging markets.</p>
						<p>&quot;Over the past three to five years AxiTrader has reinvested a large percentage of its
							profits into infrastructure to better define and manage both customers’ and the firm’s risk,
							as well as working to excel in client execution with Axi’s counterparties.&quot; - AxiCorp
							CEO Goran Drapac</p>

							Disclosure Statement (PDS) which can be accessed through the AxiTrader website by clicking
